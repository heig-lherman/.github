# HEIG-VD - My projects

Hello!

In this organisation, you'll find all my practical work
and other projects done during my studies at HEIG-VD.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This organisation is not meant to be a way for you to simply copy my work and submit it.<br>
> I don't really care if you do, but you'll learn nothing from it.
>
> Know the principles of learning brought by Thorndike: **readiness, exercise, and effect**.
>
> School is not about getting the best grades, it's about learning and understanding the
> concepts and ideas behind the courses, and to take the opportunity given to us to learn,
> assimilate and apply the knowledge we are given. Come ready for it and apply yourself,
> and you'll be rewarded with a better understanding of the subject, and better grades.
>
> School should not be competitive, even though the elitism of the Swiss education system
> wants it to be, it should be a place to learn and grow, while helping each other to do so.
> Take the time to focus on these practical works, they are a great way to reflect on what
> you have assimilated, and to have a common goal you can work towards. Keep in mind that
> when practice occurs, learning continues.
>
> A good learning environment is one where we can work together, not against each other. This
> principle applies even more in a professional environment. Get started in applying this idea,
> and use the repositories shared here as a way of mutual aid by taking it as a starting point,
> then share your own personal solutions that others would be happy to have as examples for
> their own learning exercises. You'll figure out quickly enough that this positive effect you'll
> have on others will strengthen your ability to learn and understand the subject. A work with
> great effect is one that will make you want to continue doing it.
